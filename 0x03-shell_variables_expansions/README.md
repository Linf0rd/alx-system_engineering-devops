### 7. Global variable

🌍 **Task:** A script that creates a new global variable named `BEST` with the value `School`.

### 8. Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power

➕ **Task:** A script that prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`.

### 9. Divide and rule

➗ **Task:** A script that prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line.

### 10. Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath

🖇️ **Task:** A script that displays the result of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`.
