### 0. What happens when...

üîç **Task:** This classic interview question is used to assess a candidate‚Äôs general knowledge of how the web stack works on top of the internet. Write a blog post explaining what happens when you type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) in your browser and press Enter.

### 1. Everything's better with a pretty diagram

üìä **Task:** Add a schema to your blog post illustrating the flow of the request created when you type [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) in your browser and press Enter.

## The diagram should show:

-   DNS resolution
-   The request hitting server IP on the appropriate port
-   That the traffic is encrypted
-   That the traffic goes through a firewall
-   That the request is distributed via a load balancer
